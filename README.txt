Nettle makes it easy to take crypto payments globally, reward customers and reduce your CO2e emissions, all in one place.

== Description ==

Nettle is a decentralised payment solution that rewards consumers and businesses for going Net Zero.

Choose the currencies you want to accept as payment. Integrate Nettle's checkout plug-in and start taking safe, international and secure payments hassle-free.

* Pay using stablecoins such as USDC and EURe.

= Net Zero =

Use our free business tools to track, trace and reduce your carbon footprint. What you cannot reduce, you can eliminate with NTTL Z, our carbon removal tokens to truly work towards being Net Zero.

As a merchant participating in the NTTL Z programme, you get a range of benefits beyond being Net Zero! We give you discounts on transaction fees and enable your customers to earn our very own NTTL token as a reward for spending with you. Available as as a monthly/ yearly subscription.

= Loyalty Programmes =

By working towards Net Zero, not only do you fulfil your ESGs, but you also qualify to get a free rewards pool! All your customers that spend with Nettle get a share of what is in this pool each month.

Win-win for both your business and your customers. Reward your customers with NTTL tokens for achieving Net Zero targets you are already hitting and pay less fees.

Amazing, huh?! Access to new customers, less abandoned carts and happier shoppers!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's unique about Nettle? Are you just yet another payment provider? =

We make our blockchain technology invisible, whilst retaining the same familiarity your users know. Our awesome loyalty programmes enable you to reward your customers for spending with you.
Nettle offers you a solution to lower your transaction fees for working towards Net Zero. Together, we will cool the planet, one transaction at a time.

= What coins/cryptocurrencies does Nettle Pay accept? =

Nettle Pay currently accepts ETH, ALGO, USDC, EURe and GBPC. We plan to accept more major cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, and stablecoins, such as Chinese CNHC.

= What are the fees? =

As the cryptocurrency is being sent from the customer, they will incur the network fees. There is a base transaction fee of 1.5%, However, if you choose to use the Algorand, we take care of your customer's network fees, and you will be able to benefit from a drop in transaction fees based on how much of your carbon emissions you have offset, to a minimum of 1.25%.
